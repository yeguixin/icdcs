%\begin{abstract}
%CAPTCHA is a standard secure mechanism to automated tell computers and humans, and is widely applied to prevent against malicious bot
%programs. In this study, we carry out a large scale systematic study on current text-based Captchas based on complex deformable characters
%that are augmented with both anti-segmentation and anti-recognition techniques. Unlike prior fine research that focus on the text-based
%Captchas with the same or similar styles, we present a novel generic hierarchical attack on different styles of Captchas. Our approach is
%able to translate these various styles of Captchas to a unique one using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). Using our CNN
%recognition engine, we can accurately identify the translated Captchas. We thoroughly evaluated our approach using real-world Captchas, and
%found all current text-based Captchas are vulnerable to our automated attack with an average speed of 224.35ms on an ordinary server (with
%a 3.2-GHz Inter Xeon CPU with 100-GB RAM and a TITAN Xp GPU). We also discovered that, the Captcha with complex noisy background do not
%defend against segmentation under our attack. This is demonstrated by the fact that we are able to clean out any sophisticated background
%from the Captcha image. Since our attack can break a widely of current text-based Captchas, this paper calls the community to revisit the
%risks of using text-based Captcha to defend against malicious bots.
